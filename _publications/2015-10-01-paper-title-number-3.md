This study is to develop and validate a measurement scale for measuring academic resilience for undergraduate students considering their learning situation using the scenario method. To this end, based on a comprehensive literature review, this study constructed sub-domains of academic resilience as ‘self-efficacy’, ‘situational judgment’, ‘resource utilization’, ‘vitalization’, and ‘future orientation’ and also constructed three sub-elements for each sub-domain. The preliminary version of the scale was developed with 3 scenarios for each sub-domain and 6 items for each scenario(the total of 90 items), which were revised and improved based on both a focus group interview with 7 undergraduate students and a review of content validity by 9 experts in the field of educational measurement and evaluation. Subsequently, a pilot test using a preliminary version of the scale was conducted on 133 students in S University in Seoul. Using the data, this study conducted confirmatory factor analysis and reliability analysis. Consequently, the finalized ‘Academic Resilience Scale for Undergraduate Students’(the total of 15 scenarios, 45 items) was good in terms of construct validity and reliability.
