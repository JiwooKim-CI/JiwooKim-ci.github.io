Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love (1986) describes love as composed of intimacy, passion, and commitment. However, individuals vary in how they express these elements. This article expands on Sternberg’s theory by identifying behavioral differences within each component of the triangle. To test this new theory, referred to as the Augmented Triangular Theory of the Expression of Love (ATTEL), 253 college students completed an online survey that included the Triangular Love Scale and a newly created 60-item ATTEL Scale, assessing both their current and ideal relationships. They also completed a short inventory measuring relationship and partner satisfaction. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) supported the six-subfactor structure. Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) identified distinct love profiles based on the six sub-factors. Results showed that participants with high dependence, control, and constraints reported significantly higher relationship satisfaction. The theory provides a framework for understanding love and how it is expressed in real-world situations, offering practical insights for relationship counseling, partner matching, and future research on romantic behavior.
