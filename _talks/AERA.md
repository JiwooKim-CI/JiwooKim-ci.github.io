This study uses the scenario method to develop and validate a scale measuring pre-service teacher competency in an online learning environment. After conducting a comprehensive literature review, this study constructed seven competencies of pre-service teacher in online learning environments: design/planning competency, social competency, instructive competency, technological competency, management competency, positive teacher attitude competency, and learning competency. We developed the Pre-service Teacher Competency in Online Learning Environment scale with 11 scenarios and 34 items after revising and improving it based on a focus group interview with six pre-service teachers and five in-service teachers to review face and content validity. We conducted confirmatory factor analyses and reliability analyses with 579 pre-service teachers. As a result, the scale showed good construct validity and reliability.
